# Text Retrieval: Concepts and Techniques

## Overview
This course provides a comprehensive overview of text retrievalâ€”the process of efficiently searching and ranking relevant documents from a large corpus. It covers both traditional and modern retrieval methods, highlighting advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. NLP Foundations for Text Retrieval
- Introduction to tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER) for processing text.
- Importance of NLP in improving search relevance and query understanding.

### 2. Search Paradigms: Push vs. Pull, Task-Based vs. Browsing
- Push systems (recommendations) vs. pull systems (user-initiated queries).
- Differences between task-based searches (goal-driven) and browsing (exploratory behavior).

### 3. Text Retrieval as a Ranking Problem
- How documents are ranked using TF-IDF, BM25, and cosine similarity.
- Introduction to Learning-to-Rank (LTR) models for optimizing search results.

### 4. Hybrid Search: Combining Retrieval Methods
- Keyword-based retrieval (TF-IDF, BM25) combined with semantic and neural retrieval (word embeddings, transformers).
- Hybrid models improve accuracy by leveraging both traditional and deep learning approaches.

### 5. Efficient Search with Inverted Index
- The role of inverted indexes in optimizing large-scale text search.
- Structure and implementation in modern search engines.

### 6. Evaluation Metrics for Retrieval Systems
- Measuring search effectiveness using Precision, Recall, F1-score, MAP, and NDCG.
- Importance of evaluation in improving search algorithms.

### 7. Feedback Mechanisms for Search Improvement
- Implementing relevance feedback and query expansion for better results.
- How user interactions refine retrieval performance.

### 8. Parallel Indexing with MapReduce
- How MapReduce enables scalable indexing for massive datasets.
- Parallel processing for handling large-scale search operations.

### 9. Future of Web Search
- Emerging trends in AI-powered search engines.
- The impact of transformers, neural search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Conclusion
This course bridges foundational search concepts with modern AI-driven approaches, equipping learners with the knowledge to build efficient, scalable, and intelligent search systems.
